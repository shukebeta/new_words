## Commenting Principles

### Avoid Redundant Comments

- **Do not write comments that simply restate what the code clearly shows.**
  - **Bad:** `x = 5; // Assign 5 to x`
  - **Good:** Focus comments on *why* something is done, or to explain complex or non-obvious logic.
- **Self-documenting code is preferred.** Strive to write code that is clear and expressive enough to not need comments for basic understanding.
- **Comments should add value.** If a comment doesn't provide additional insight beyond what the code says, it's likely redundant.
  - Consider if the comment explains the *intent* or *purpose* that isn't immediately obvious from the code.
  - Consider if the comment clarifies a non-trivial decision or trade-off.ZZ
